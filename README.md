"# portalInterview" 
The helloWorld is included in the file 'helloWorld'
The event planner is not finished. I create the class 'eventPlan' and the users choose to type in the event information (name, year, month, day, time) or quit adding events. 
There is a array in eventPlan and the event information typed by user are saved as objects and push into the array. 
For day, month and year, they are easy to see if overlaped.
If all of them above are overlaped, then transfer the time into float number (hour.minu) and pm is the (hour + 12 . minu)
deciding if overlape with previous event.
